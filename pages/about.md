Hello! My name is Emily Ashe, and I am a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University, currently enrolled in the User Experience Design program. I am an aspiring UX designer who is creative and has a great interest in technology. I have a passion for dance and a passion for travel. I was a dancer for 13 years, and a competitive dancer for 9 of those 13 years. Competitive dance allowed me to travel all over the United States, however I have also travelled in my spare time to places like the Bahamas, Costa Rica, Wales England, and London England, with my favourite being Costa Rica.
