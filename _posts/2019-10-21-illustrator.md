In my graphic design class, we have been learning how to use the adobe creative suite. I found that I personally excelled in Adobe Illustrator, because all of the designs I made seemed to be quite interesting and fun! This assignment was being done when I was learning how to us the pen tool for the first time which is trickier than it seems, but with practice, I was able to get a cute cartoon donut character.
