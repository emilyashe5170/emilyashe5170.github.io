**My Angle:**
---
This was created in my graphic design class while learning photoshop. We were given an image, and we had to non-destructively recolour the handle of the razor and use the proper phrase at the top. It was originally grey, however we altered the colour of the razor to match the colours of the brand Harry's, then we made it into a gif.
